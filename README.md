# CHAPTER 2 DATA TYPES, CONSTANTS, VARIABLES AND ARRAYS
* The C language supports a number of data types.
* Because most CPUs generally support these data types directly, it is
unnecessary for the compiler to convert the data types into the types the CPU
understands. 
* C provides the mechanisms to create and use types of data created by the programmer.
#### Type- Size- Description:
* char- 1- byte Used for characters or integer variables.
* int- 2 or 4- bytes Used for integer values.
* float- 4- bytes Floating-point numbers.
* double- 8- bytes Floating-point numbers.
