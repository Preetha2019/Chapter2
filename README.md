# CHAPTER 2 DATA TYPES, CONSTANTS, VARIABLES AND ARRAYS
* The C language supports a number of data types.
* Because most CPUs generally support these data types directly, it is
unnecessary for the compiler to convert the data types into the types the CPU
understands. 
* C provides the mechanisms to create and use types of data created by the programmer.
